## void main()

Dart를 실행시키면 가장 먼저 볼 수 있는 코드입니다. dart는 코드를 볼때 main 함수를 가장 먼저 실행시킵니다.

**그렇기에 `class`를 `main`함수 밖에 만든 후, 이를 main에 넣어 줘야 실행이 됩니다.**



## Scaffold : 화면의 도화지!

그리고 일단 나머지는 생략하고 가장먼저 Scaffold 를 찾으세요.

어플리케이션 전체가 하나의 스케치북이라면

각각화면의 Scaffold가 있습니다. 화면마다 Scaffold가 도화지라고 생각하시면됩니다.

우리는 일단 Scaffold부터 배워봅시다.

Scaffold에서 우리는 무엇을을 넣을수있을까요?
